        I’m a software engineer by profession with a flair for the creative. I’m passionate about

        researchers to access and interact with bioinformatic and genomic data.

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="faded-rule-left w-full my-3"></div>
      <p class="line-height-3 mb-4">
        Growing up in rural downeast Maine, I received my first MacBook through school in 7th grade
        and, even back then, I was fiddling around with slideshow presentations, over-applying
        transitions and effects, learning all of the OS shortcuts, and dabbling with programs like
        SketchUp. Skip to my freshman year at a liberal arts college, I took a CS-101 learning basic
        Python and I knew I wanted to go into software. I transferred to Moravian College (now
        Moravian University) for the remainder of my undergrad as a Computer Science major. Some of
        my Junior and Senior year elective courses including mobile computing, networking, and,
        leaning into my creative talents, graphic design, typography and interactive design.
      </p>
      <p class="line-height-3 mb-4">
        After graduation in 2017, I moved back home to Maine to search for a job and landed a
        6-month internship at The Jackson Laboratory which turned into a full-time position as a
        scientific software engineer. Within the first year there, I had started to become known as
        the go-to frontend developer as I had the uncommon combination frontend development
        expertise and designer-like intuition so my work stood out from the many web applications
        where the frontends often felt like afterthoughts. I’d like to think that my Angular
        development was a significant contributor to why our teams have adopted it officially as the
        default web frontend framework and that my passion and dedication to making attractive and
        functional UIs that developing for positive user experiences is just as important as
        building a well-architected backend.
      </p>
      <p class="line-height-3 mb-4">
        Currently my workdays are spent applying bugfixes and developing new features for various
        frontends. One such project has me redesigning and modernizing the UI for an application
        that has been a community resource since the early 2000s that currently exists as a
        full-stack Python Flask with Jinja2 templating into a distributed system with a more
        user-centered approach to UX. We're still early in the design phase, doing what we can to
        gather user and stakeholder feedback.
      </p>
      <p class="line-height-3">
        In my free time I enjoy cooking, reading, playing video games, occasionally playing around
        with small coding experiments, hanging out with my two cats and building custom keyboards.
